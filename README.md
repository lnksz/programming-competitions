# Coding Competitions

Even though I am participating for fun instead of taking these competitions too
seriously, it is nice to have them checked in here esp. if I learn something new
from them.

## Advent of Code

Funny little tasks with A and B parts for each day of December.
I heard about this from code_report videos and the Russ Cox's video series using Ivy.
There is no time pressure, so I can play with stuff I never have time for!

## Google's Kickstart

This is organized really professionally. There are around 6 rounds and some practice rounds
over the year. The 4 tasks over 3 hours give a great opportunity to focus on algorithms
and datastructures.
The submission and judging system is great! I always enjoy when the test-suite points
out some flow automatically. This is even available in practice mode after the
competition, so I can practice afterwards. There are also official write-ups after
the deadline so that is also a great way to learn something new.

It is pretty amazing what Google put together for free. But attending all rounds
is hard, because they distribute the rounds so that every timezone has a fair
chance! (My first ever round was on a Sunday at 5a.m. after a wedding :D)
