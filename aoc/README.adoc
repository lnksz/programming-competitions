My solutions to the AoC tasks, with focus on exploration and fun.

== 2021

My first AoC. I want to use these fun little riddles to try out programming
languages and maybe tooling around them. Stuff which I collect on my to-do
list, but have missed the opportunity to try them out during the year. I like
how these mini tasks offer a nice way to mess around new things without
commiting to a full side-project.

I started off using https://repl.com[repl.com], but then decided to also create
this repo to gather my notes around the solutions.

=== Day 0.

Trying out https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/[Asciidoctor] as a
Markdown alternative.

=== Day 1. - Depth Scan (Rust)

After hearing so much about rust, it is time to try it out!

* Reading a file : https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-02-reading-a-file.html
* Iterator : https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html
** `windows()` <3

The syntax sure needs some getting used to. But I am impressed with the
functional toolbox. And this "iter.collect.iter.collect" schema does look
promissing! I started to think, how general this sliding window use-case is,
and how I would implement it in C. Then discovered `windows()` in the docs...
Neat!

The pattern matching and the borrow-checker will need some more learning...

.Building and running the solution
[source,bash]
----
# Sample data-set part-1
cargo run sample.txt a
# Input data-set part-2
cargo run input.txt b
----

=== Day 2. - Keyword navigation (awk)

I've been using awk to print some selected columns from files... But knew it
could do more!

* `-v=0` flag is redundant, because variables are initialized to 0

I think I will use awk more in my day-to-day work. Pretty awesome to have match
based actions!

.Running the solution
[source,bash]
----
./aoc-2021-02.sh sample a
./aoc-2021-02.sh input b
